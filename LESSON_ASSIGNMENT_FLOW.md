### What Happens When a Lesson is Assigned:

When a teacher assigns a lesson from the Comprehensive Library, the system creates a homework entry with:

```javascript
{
  title: "Lesson Title (e.g., 'Introduction to Fractions')",
  description: "Detailed lesson description with learning objectives",
  type: "lesson", // Identifies this as a library lesson
  lesson_id: "unique_lesson_id",
  due_date: "7 days from now",
  points: 10, // Default points value
  materials: ["Worksheets", "Videos", "Interactive Activities"],
  objectives: ["Learning goal 1", "Learning goal 2", "Learning goal 3"],
  duration: "45 minutes",
  difficulty: "intermediate",
  assignment_type: "class" | "individual", // New field
  classes: [1, 2, 3], // All teacher's classes (for class assignments)
  students: [15, 23, 41] // Specific student IDs (for individual assignments)
}
```

### What Parents See on Their Dashboard:

#### For Class Assignments:
All students in the class receive the lesson as described in the original flow.

#### For Individual Assignments:
